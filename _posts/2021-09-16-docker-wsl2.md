## Introduction

Normally, Window users use Docker through an application called **Docker Desktop**. It has GUI, it seem to be friendly with user.

</div>

But if you are a fan of [**Docker Command**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/) because of the consistency through various environment and OS, you love typing command on terminal or you like to develop and write documentation for other developer, this article is for you.

In this article, I would like to share how to install Docker directly in your WSL2 distribution and use Docker command like the way we use Docker on a Linux machine or Macbook terminal.

## Install Docker step by step

Now let go to your Linux distro terminal

* Install the repository and some dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
```

* Now install docker, `ubuntu` is my username when installing WSL2, modify it to yours

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce
```

* Add my default user to group Docker so that I don't need `sudo` to use Docker everytime

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
```

* Make the change affect, change `ubuntu` to your username, same with previous step

```bash
sudo su
```

```bash
su ubuntu
```

* Now Docker is ready to use, last but not least step, start the Docker service

```bash
sudo service docker start
```

It's great to see a result like this

    <img src="/img/docker-wsl2/startservice.png">

    </figure>
</div>

* Check again to make sure docker is ready

```bash
docker ps -a
```
If you see result like this, you can start using Docker command
