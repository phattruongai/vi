summary: |-
    Fee: 300$

    The total time of the test is 3,5 hours, answer all 65 questions at the first time, flag unsure answers, then return to check carefully all reliable questions (to make sure that you do not misread or wrongly choose), then find the flag answer to carefully read and infer again.

## 1. AWS's recommended knowledge and experience:

***Check this link for full details: [click here](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/)***

> **There are 4 domains within 65 questions in this exam:**
> 1. Data engineering: 20%
> 2. Exploratory data analysis: 24%
> 3. Modeling: 36%
> 4. Machine learning implementation: 20%

* 1-2 years of experience developing, architecting, or running ML/deep learning workloads on the AWS Cloud
* The ability to express the intuition behind basic ML algorithms
* Experience performing basic hyperparameter optimization
* Experience with ML and deep learning frameworks
* The ability to follow model-training best practices
* The ability to follow deployment and operational best practices

## 2. My recommendation:

> ***In my opinion, this certificate consists of 2 big elements***

* Machine learning (building,training,evaluation,deployment)
* AWS services used for implementing everything above inside AWS infrastructure.
* *It will be easier if you are a Machine Learning practioner before, you just need to learn AWS infrastructure.*

> **Me before the certificate**

* 2 years experience in Machine Learning & Deep Learning, but I am not too familiar with data mining, exploratory data analysis because I mainly work on computer vision (of course I've already learned data science before, but maybe at that time I like doing something than learning data so haha, i missed it), thus it's take me a punch of time to review all the knowledge around data as visualization, data insight, evaluation, use case, etc.
* Nearly 4 months of exposure to AWS (actually my knowledge at this time is just limited around S3 for storage, EC2 for training model, and a little bit of IAM for manage user, policy, resouces, etc.), so don't worry, nothing's impossible :D 
* I have reviewed everything while still working in a company for about 3 months, I'm also procrastinative too much so you absolutely can achieve it in a shorter time.

## 3. Documentation:

* **Course AWS Developer - Associate**: to familiar with the basic services of AWS, you do not need to take this certificate but just take it if you want, [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrKRN9zRBWs) (on youtube, no quiz, no engsub or vietsub anymore since it's to long - 11 hours, but free), or [acloud.guru](https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-developer-associate) (It charges fee, also has english subtitle, quiz and hands-on lab, I learnt here because my company pay everything)


* **Course AWS Machine Learning - Specialty**: all knowledge of the main certificate, I studied at [acloud.guru](https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty), but I have figured out another course at [linuxacademy](https://linuxacademy.com/course/aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty/) seem more detailed and also recommended my boss pay this course for other people in company.


* **Developer Guide of services** & **White paper on AWS**: while studying and reviewing you need to explore deeper about services, so just google the service's documentation on the AWS website whenever you confuse, there are also the recommended resouces in the course, just take a look at them, I found a useful white paper about Big data solution on AWS at [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-data-lakes/building-data-lake-aws.html), you should read it.


* **Practice**: Let try as much as possible every service you meet during studying. Pay more attention to Sagemaker, it is the heart of machine learning on AWS. Don't skip any hand-ons lab when you meet it in the courses.


* **Trial exam**: the benefit of the paid course is the trial exam at the end of course, I have took the exams of ***Acloud.guru*** (fully explanation), ***Whizlab*** (detailed explanation, a kind guy gave me his account having this course) and ***Examtopic*** (Don't believe the answer of this page since it's not accurate, let figure out by yourself the correct answer by reading documentation and discussion). The night before the exam I was still not assured so I decided to pay one more exam of ***Udemy*** (also has detailed explanation). Moreover, AWS have the simulation with 20 questions but it's too expensive (40$) so I didn't pay, I only did its free sample exam - **[link](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-ml/AWS-Certified-Machine-Learning-Specialty_Sample-Questions.pdf)**


* Besides, bear in your mind that it's always have strange services as AWS Batch, AWS Step Function or Deeplens, DeepRacer, IOT Greengrass, Iot Core, etc. Please try to take a look at these things to make sure you don't confuse any of them even if they appear in a wrong choice. Let strongly review the knowledge of probability and statistics as Bernulli distribution, Binomial distribution, Poisson distribution, Pearson correlation coefficient, residual plot, Naive Bayes, Full Bayes, etc. Almost question which I don't know or ensure the right answer is belong to this domain, the inference question of statistics and probability, although there are not many question of this type but better safe than sorry, right? :D

* You should read really carefully the question and infer the context of using services.

Example:

> Between Batch and Step Function, if you have a complete process, you want run it on many compute resources that you can manage, schedule this process easily, Batch is the choice.

> In contrast, you have a process of many steps that each step need a different compute resource or service, you want to combine these steps into a complete procedure thus Step Function is your best choice.

There are also many other types of question, like which services or composition of services is the best choice, fastest choice, most efficient or cost-effective choice, etc. You need to figure out by do as much as you can the trial exam and read the explanation carefully. Good luck!

## 4. Let's go to the place to do the examination:

* Book the exam: at http://aws.training
* Fee: 300$.
* If you are not native speaker, choose ESL (English second language) to be added 30 minutes.
* Strategy: the total time of the test is 3,5 hours, answer all 65 questions at the first time, flag unsure answers, then return to check carefully all reliable questions (to make sure that you do not misread or wrongly choose), then find the flag answer to carefully read and infer again. In my case, at the first turn I flagged 15 answers and used all 3,5 hours to check and check 3 times my exam.
* After click on the "End test" button, you will know immediately your result as pass or fail.
* After about 2 days, they will send you a email to inform the result again and you can check the score at their site.


And here are my accomplishment kk
